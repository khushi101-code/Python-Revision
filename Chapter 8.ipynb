    "Patterns, trends and coorelations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization techniques or tools such as line chart, bar chart, pie chart, histogram, scatter chart etc.Thus with data visualization tools, information can be processed in efficient manner and hence better decisions can be made."

    "Ans - A network id an interconnected collection of autonomous computers that can share and exchange information.\n",
    "Major reasons that emphasize on the need of networks are:\n",
    "    (1)Resource Sharing Through a network,data,software and hardware resources can be shared irrespective of the physical location of the resources and the user.\n",
    "    (2)Realiablity A file can have its copies on two or more computers of the network,so it one of them is unavailabe,the other copies should be used.That makes a network more reliable.\n",
    "    (3)Reduced Costs Since resources can be shared,it greatly reduces the costs.\n",
    "    (4)Fast communication With networks,it is possible to exchange information at very fast speeds."

    "Ans - Small computer networks that are confined to a localised area(e.g, an office, a building or a factory) are known as local area networks(LANs).The key purpose of a LAN is to serve its users in resource sharing.The hardware as well as software resources are shared through LANs.For instance,LAN users can share data,information,programs,printers,hard-disks,modems etc.One node has a printer connected to it and other nodes on the LAN can communicate with it in ordre to print files and hence allowing expensive peripherals to be shared among numbers of users."
